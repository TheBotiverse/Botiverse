<p>
<b>Botiverse</b> is Python package that bridges the gap between developers <i>regardless of their machine learning expertise</i> and 
building chatbots. It offers a <b>diverse set</b> of <b>modern chatbot architectures</b> that are <b>ready to be trained</b> in a <b>high-level fashion</b> while 
offering optional <b>fine-grained control</b> for advanced use-cases.
</p>

Check this for the <a href="https://botiverse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a>.

## üöÄ Installation
For standard use, consider
```shell
pip install botiverse
```
<p>
This installs botiverse excluding the dependencies needed for the voice bot and its preprocessors. To include those as well, 
consider installing
</p>

```shell
pip install botiverse[voice]
```
and make sure to also have FFMPEG on your machine, as needed by the unavoidable dependency `PyAudio`.

## üèÆ Basic Demo
Import the chatbot you need from `botiverse.bots`. All bots have a similar interface consisting of a read, train and infer method.

```python
from botiverse.bots import BasicBot

# make a chatbot instance
bot = BasicBot(machine='nn', repr='tf-idf')
# read the data
bot.read_data('dataset.json')
# train the chatbot
bot.train()
# infer
bot.infer("Hello there!")
```

## üí• Supported Chatbots
Botiverse offers 7 main chatbot architectures that cover a wide variety of use cases:

  <tr>
    <td>Basic Bot</td>
    <td>A light-weight intent-based chatbot based on classical or deep classiciation models</td>
    <td>Answer frequently asked questions on a website while remaining insensitive to wording</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Whiz Bot</td>
    <td>A multi-lingual intent-based chatbot based on deep sequential models</td>
    <td>Similar to basic bot but suitable for cases where there is more data or better performance or multilinguality is needed in return of more computation</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Task Bot</td>
    <td>A task-oriented chatbot based on encoder transformer models</td>
    <td>A chatbot that can collect all the needed information to perform a task such as booking a flight or a hotel</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Basic Task Bot</td>
    <td>A basic light-weight version of the task bot purely based on Regex and grammars</td>
    <td>When insufficient data exists for the deep version and developers are willing to design a general grammar for the task</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Converse Bot</td>
    <td>A conversational chatbot based on language modeling with transformers</td>
    <td>A chatbot that converses similar to human agents; e.g., like a narrow version of ChatGPT as customer service</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Voice Bot</td>
    <td>A voice bot that simulates a call state machine based on deep speech and embedding models</td>
    <td>A voice bot that collects important information from callers before transferring them to a real agent</td>

    <td>Theorizer</td>
    <td>Based on deep classification and language models</td>

## üí• Supported Preprocessors and Models

- All chatbot architectures that Botiverse support (i.e., in `botiverse.bots`) are composed of a representer that puts the input text or audio in the right representation and a model that is responsible for the model's output.
- All representers (top row) and models (bottom row) with a non-white frame were implemented from scratch for some definition of that.
- Beyond being a chatbot package, most representers and models can be also used independently and share the same API. For instance, you can import your favorite model or representer from `botiverse.models` or `botiverse.preprocessors` respectively and use it for any task.
- Some chatbot architectures also allows using a customly defined representer or model as long as it satisfies the relevant interface.
